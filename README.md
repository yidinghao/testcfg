## Testing distributional learnability properties of context-free grammars.

This is a copy of the repository [testcfg](https://github.com/alexc17/testcfg), which contains code for running experiments described in Alexander Clark's paper [Testing Distributional Properties of Context-Free Grammars](http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v57/clark16.pdf). This fork contains code I have written to run additional experiments based on those described in the paper.
